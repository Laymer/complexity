Building
--------

You need to have the following installed:
  * Erlang QuickCheck
  * The Haskell platform
  * GLPK, the GNU Linear Programming Kit

Plus optionally:
  * gnuplot

After that, first install the Haskell bindings to GLPK with:
  cabal update
  cabal install hmatrix-glpk

Then build the tool with make.

Running examples
----------------

There are several examples in examples.erl. Pick one of them and run it:

  > examples:median_of_three_qsort().

This example tests an implementation of quicksort.

You will see the tool generate some test cases and then after a while
print out its guess at the function's complexity:

  Worst-case complexity: O(n^2)
  Best-case complexity: O(n)

Don't take this output as gospel: the tool also produces a graph for
you to look at. Open the file plot.pdf and you will see a plot of the
tests the tool ran. The red crosses are test cases. The x-axis shows
the size of each test case and the y-axis shows the number of BEAM
reductions evaluating that test case.  The tool has also fitted two
curves which envelope the data; you can see the curves and their
formulas. The upper curve has y proportional to x^2 and fits tightly
above the
