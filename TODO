* Get AVL trees working.
* Maybe switch back to a single candidate at a time?
  But still record the best test for each size.
  Either that, or make sure to continue to the maximum size.
* Allow the user to define size measures to help the heuristics.
* Measure elapsed time better.
* Merge noise branch.
* Write generic command support.
* Try congruence closure as an example.
* Fix AVL example by: measuring the maximum height of any intermediate
  tree; using depth as the complexity measure instead of lookup time.
